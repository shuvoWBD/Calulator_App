# Calulator_App

A simple and user friendly calculator app built with Python and Tkinter for performing everyday calculations.

🚀**Project Overview:**

This is a Python-based calculator developed using the Tkinter GUI library. The calculator performs standard arithmetic operations such as +, −, ×, ÷, percentage, square root, and positive/negative toggle. It displays results directly on the interface and is suitable for beginners learning Python GUI development.



✨**Key Features:**

1.**Scientific-Style Calculator Interface:**

The calculator follows a familiar layout similar to modern mobile calculators, making it intuitive for users.

2.**Basic and Advanced Operations:**

It supports:

 ✔ Basic arithmetic: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division

 ✔  Percentage calculation

 ✔ Square root operation

✔  Sign toggle (+/-)

3.Dynamic Button Layout:
Buttons are generated from a 2D list, which makes the layout easy to modify or extend without rewriting UI code.

4.Real-Time Display Update:
The display updates instantly as buttons are pressed, showing the current expression or result.

5.Clear and Error Handling:

 ✔ “AC” clears the entire expression

 ✔ Invalid expressions are safely handled and show an “Error” message instead of crashing

6.Visual Button Categorization:
Different colors are used for:

 ✔ Operator buttons

 ✔ Top function buttons

 ✔ Number buttons:
This improves usability and visual clarity.




🛠️**Technical Architecture:**

1.Programming Language and Libraries:

 ✔ Language: Python

 ✔ GUI Framework: Tkinter

 ✔ Math Functions: math module

2.State Management:
  A single string variable expression stores the entire user input and current calculation state.

3.Event-Driven Design:
Each button click triggers the button_clicked() function, which processes the input based on button type.

4.Expression Parsing and Evaluation:

 ✔ User-friendly symbols (×, ÷) are internally converted to Python operators

 ✔ The built-in eval() function is used to evaluate expressions

5.Modular UI Construction:

 ✔ Button labels and layout are defined separately from logic

 ✔ UI elements are created dynamically using loops, reducing repetition

6.Error Control Flow:
try-except blocks prevent runtime errors during evaluation, square root, and percentage operations.

7.Separation of Logic and Presentation:

 ✔ Calculation logic handled in button_clicked()

 ✔ Display rendering handled by the update_label() function

 ✔ Styling handled through predefined color constants
